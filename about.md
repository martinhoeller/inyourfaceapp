<blockquote>
Hi! I am Martin, the creator of <strong>In Your Face</strong>.
</blockquote>

## Why I Created **In Your Face**
The app was inspired by a former coworker who would always be late to our meetings. He was so focused on his work that he constantly would miss calendar notifications.
At a company outing – after more than one beer – I said to him "You really need a reminder *in your face* to be on time. I'm going to make an app especially for you."
This is how **In Your Face** was born.

## About Me
I am a freelance iOS and macOS developer and consultant based in Florence, Italy, Europe.
My professional software development career began in 2006 and my main expertise is on Apple's platforms since then (iOS / iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS).

Originally I am from Graz, Austria. I moved to Berlin in 2013 and stayed there for more than 8 years before deciding to move to Italy in 2022. Besides writing software I also like food, travelling, music, swimming and photography.
