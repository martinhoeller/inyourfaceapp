### MacBook with camera notch
If you are running the app on a MacBook with a camera notch the app icon might be hidden behind that. Try hiding some other menu bar icons and see if the In Your Face icon appears.

### Menu bar management apps
Are you using a menu bar management app like Bartender? Check the configuration. Maybe the app is hiding the In Your Face menu icon.
