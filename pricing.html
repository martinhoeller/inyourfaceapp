faq:
  - question: Why subscriptions?
    answer: Continuously improving the app, adding new features or answering support requests takes a lot of time and effort. This is not a hobby project, it is my job. Building and maintaining a sustainable business is only possible with recurring revenue.
  - question: What happens when the free trial ends?
    answer: After the trial ends the app automatically switches back to the FREE version and you will no longer be able to use any of the PREMIUM features.
  - question: What happens if I cancel the PREMIUM subscription?
    answer: You will still be able to use the PREMIUM features until the end of the subscription term. After that the app automatically switches back to the FREE version.
  - question: Can I get a refund?
    answer: If you don't like the app or it does not work for you then you can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084">request a refund from Apple</a>. Developers can not directly issue refunds.
  - question: What if I bought the app before the switch to the subscription model?
    answer: Users who bought the app before the switch to the subscription model (August 2022) will keep all the features the app had until then. <b>No features have been taken away</b> or limited in any way. Any new major features however require a subscription.
