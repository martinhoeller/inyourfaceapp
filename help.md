<h2 id="how-iyf-works">How <strong>In Your Face</strong> works</h2>
**In Your Face** runs in the backround on your computer and monitors events in calendars that are available in the macOS Calendar app.
It knows your next upcoming event, and shows a full-screen reminder one minute before it starts (or whichever time you configured in the app's preferences).

<h2 id="how-to-add-google"> How to add a Google, Exchange, or Yahoo calendar</h2>
It is very easy to set up reminders for any calendar service that is supported by the macOS Calendar app. Follow these steps:

1. Open the macOS Calendar app
2. Open the Calendar preferences window via the menu Calendar > Preferencesâ€¦
3. Click the "Accounts" tab in the toolbar

4. Click the + button at the bottom of the accounts list
5. Choose the appropriate account type and follow the instructions to authenticate your account

6. Make sure your newly added calendar shows up in the Calendar app

Now you are all set up and **In Your Face** should be able to recognize your newly added calendar and show reminders for it.

<h2 id="outlook"> Does <strong>In Your Face</strong> support Microsoft Outlook?</h2>
Unfortunately **In Your Face** does not have access to calendars in the Microsoft Outlook app. However, if you have a Microsoft Exchange account you can follow the instructions above for adding it to the macOS Calendar app.

<h1 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h1>
<h2> Why is there a paid <strong>subscription</strong>?</h2>
Since the first version of **In Your Face** the app has constantly received new features and improvements. Long term this is not sustainable for an independant software developer like me. The choices are either stop development of the app entirely or get recurring revenue from existing users to keep the app going.

<h2> I bought the app in the past. Do I need a <strong>subscription</strong>?</h2>
If you bought the app on the App Store in the past you can continue using it as before. **No features are taken away from you** and there is no need for a subscription. However, access to all new features requires a subscription.
