### How **In Your Face** works
**In Your Face** runs in the backround on your system and monitors events in calendars that are available in the macOS Calendar app.
It knows your next upcoming event, and shows a full-screen reminder one minute before it starts (or whichever time you configured in the settings).

### How to add a Google calendar
It is very easy to set up reminders for Google calendars. Follow these steps:

1. Open the macOS Calendar app
2. Open the Calendar preferences window via the menu Calendar > Preferencesâ€¦
3. Click the "Accounts" tab in the toolbar

6. Make sure your Google calendar shows up in the calendars

Now you are all set up and **In Your Face** should be able to recognize and show reminders for your Google calendar events.

### Does **In Your Face** support Outlook calendars?
Unfortunately Microsoft Outlook does not support the CalDAV synchronization standard. Therefore it is currently not possible for I Your Face to show reminders for Outlook calendars.
