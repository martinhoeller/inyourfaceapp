### How **In Your Face** works
**In Your Face** runs in the backround on your system and monitors events in calendars that are available in the macOS Calendar app.
It knows your next upcoming event, and shows a full-screen reminder one minute before it starts (or whichever time you configured in the settings).

### How to add a Google, Exchange, or Yahoo calendar
It is very easy to set up reminders for any calendar service that is supported by the macOS Calendar app. Follow these steps:

1. Open the macOS Calendar app
2. Open the Calendar preferences window via the menu Calendar > Preferencesâ€¦
3. Click the "Accounts" tab in the toolbar

5. Choose the appropriate account type and follow the instructions to authenticate your account

6. Make sure your newly added calendar shows up in the Calendar app

Now you are all set up and **In Your Face** should be able to recognize your newly added calendar and show reminders for it.
