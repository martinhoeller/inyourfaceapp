<h2 id="how-iyf-works">How <strong>In Your Face</strong> works</h2>
**In Your Face** runs in the backround on your computer and monitors events in calendars that are available in the macOS Calendar app.
It knows your next upcoming event, and shows a full-screen reminder one minute before it starts (or whichever time you configured in the app's preferences).

<h2 id="how-to-add-google"> How to add a Google, Exchange, or Yahoo calendar</h2>
It is very easy to set up reminders for any calendar service that is supported by the macOS Calendar app. Follow these steps:

1. Open the macOS Calendar app
2. Open the Calendar preferences window via the menu Calendar > Preferencesâ€¦
3. Click the "Accounts" tab in the toolbar

6. Make sure your newly added calendar shows up in the Calendar app

Now you are all set up and **In Your Face** should be able to recognize your newly added calendar and show reminders for it.
