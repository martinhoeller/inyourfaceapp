<h2 id="how-iyf-works">How <strong>In Your Face</strong> works</h2>
**In Your Face** runs in the background on your computer and monitors events in calendars that are available in the macOS Calendar app.
It knows your next upcoming event, and shows a full-screen alert one minute before it starts (or whichever time you configured in the app's settings).

<h2 id="how-to-add-google"> How to add a Google, Exchange, or Yahoo calendar</h2>
It is very easy to set up alerts for any calendar service that is supported by the macOS Calendar app. Follow these steps:

1. Open the macOS Calendar app
2. Open the Calendar settings window via the menu Calendar > Settingsâ€¦
3. Click the "Accounts" tab in the toolbar

5. Choose the appropriate account type and follow the instructions to authenticate your account

6. Make sure your newly added calendar shows up in the Calendar app

Now you are all set up and **In Your Face** should be able to recognize your newly added calendar and show alerts for it.

<h2 id="outlook"> Does <strong>In Your Face</strong> support Microsoft Outlook?<br>Does it work with Fantastical or BusyCal?</h2>
Unfortunately **In Your Face** does not have access to calendars in other proprietary calendar apps like Microsoft Outlook or Fantastical.
However, if you have a Microsoft Exchange account you can follow the instructions above for adding it to the macOS Calendar app.
