In Your Face’s Story

The app was inspired by a former coworker who would always be late to our meetings. He was so focused on his work that he constantly would miss calendar notifications. At a company outing – after more than one beer – I said to him “You really need a reminder in your face to be on time. I’m going to make an app especially for you.” This is how In Your Face was born.
